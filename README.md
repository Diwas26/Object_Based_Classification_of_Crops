# Object_Based_Classification_of_Crops


The script gives you the sample approach for classfying the given area like feild, district or even entire state based on the classified Ground Truth points. This repository provides us with some robust approach for classifying the shape objects and providing them with symbology that can prove effective while plotting. The approch is robust and tested on small to very large areas and have done effectively well in classification of objects in relatively short span of time.
